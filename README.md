# RL Game

# Overview
The Rushi Grid Game is a reinforcement learning demonstration where an agent named Rushi navigates through a grid to reach a target, named Sleep, while avoiding obstacles. This project illustrates the implementation of the Q-learning algorithm in a simple and interactive way.

# Features
- Interactive Grid Environment
- Agent named Rushi navigating to reach Sleep
- Obstacles like Instagram, Movies, and YouTube
- Reinforcement Learning using Q-learning
- Visual representation of the agent's learning process

# How It Works
Rushi starts at the top-left corner of the grid and aims to reach Sleep located at the bottom-right corner. The grid has obstacles that Rushi must avoid to reach the target successfully.

# Game GUI
### Here is what the game looks like:

# Q-Learning Explained
- Q-values represent the expected future rewards for taking certain actions in specific states.
- Rushi learns to navigate by updating these Q-values, improving its strategy over time to reach Sleep efficiently.
